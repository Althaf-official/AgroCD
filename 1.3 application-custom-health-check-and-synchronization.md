### Synchronize the health-check-app application and access the app using HealthCheckApp button on the top of the workspace.


Run the below command, to synchronize health-check-app application:


```argocd app sync health-check-app```

```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  argocd app sync health-check-app

### Review the moving-shapes-colors configmap. It should include the data of 5shapes, but in the UI we only see 4 shapes.

```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get cm moving-shapes-colors -o yaml -n health-check
apiVersion: v1
data:
  CIRCLE_COLOR: pink
  OVAL_COLOR: lightgreen
  RECTANGLE_COLOR: blue
  SQUARE_COLOR: orange
  TRIANGLE_COLOR: white
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"v1","data":{"CIRCLE_COLOR":"pink","OVAL_COLOR":"lightgreen","RECTANGLE_COLOR":"blue","SQUARE_COLOR":"orange","TRIANGLE_COLOR":"white"},"kind":"ConfigMap","metadata":{"annotations":{},"labels":{"app.kubernetes.io/instance":"health-check-app"},"name":"moving-shapes-colors","namespace":"health-check"}}
  creationTimestamp: "2024-01-11T16:36:33Z"
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: health-check-app

  resourceVersion: "12699"
  uid: 0549bb1a-c88d-42f9-be1a-cda2f2acdd8a

controlplane ~ ➜  
```

### Write a custom health-check script in ArgoCD to change the application health status if the TRAINGLE_COLOR is white in the configmap. The status should be as below.


    Health Status = DEGRADED

    Health Message = Use any color other than White


```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  vi patch.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl patch configmap argocd-cm -n argocd --patch-file patch.yaml 
configmap/argocd-cm patched

controlplane ~ ➜  cat patch.yaml 
  data:
    resource.customizations.health.ConfigMap: |
      hs = {}
      hs.status = "Healthy"
       if obj.data.TRIANGLE_COLOR == "white" then
          hs.status = "Degraded"
          hs.message = "Use any color other than White "
       end
      return hs

controlplane ~ ➜  
```

### Refresh the health-check-app application in the ArgoCD UI. What is the health status of the application now?


![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/AgroCD/assets/105126131/23df544f-2e03-4051-aa81-f66e37cae363)


#### In gitops-argocd repository, update the value of TRAINGLE_COLOR to red within the health-check/configmap.yml file.


You can either make changes directly from Gitea or clone the repository and add/push your changes.


Next, sync the application from ArgoCD UI, enable PRUNE and FORCE options while syncing the application to make sure changes are in effect immediately.


What is the status of the health-check-app after the Sync?


Login to the Gitea server and edit gitops-argocd/health-check/configmap.yml file, change value for TRIANGLE_COLOR from white to red. Finally commit the changes.


Now, login to the ArgoCD UI and click on SYNC for health-check-app application, enable PRUNE and FORCE options and click on SYNCHRONIZE then Ok.


The status of the health-check-app application should be healthy now.

### What is the SYNC POLICY of health-check-app application?

```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  argocd app get health-check-app
Name:               argocd/health-check-app
Project:            default
Server:             https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace:          health-check
URL:                https://localhost:32766/applications/health-check-app

Target:             HEAD
Path:               ./health-check
SyncWindow:         Sync Allowed
Sync Policy:        <none>
Sync Status:        Synced to HEAD (183a3bd)
Health Status:      Healthy

GROUP  KIND        NAMESPACE     NAME                  STATUS  HEALTH   HOOK  MESSAGE
       ConfigMap   health-check  moving-shapes-colors  Synced  Healthy        configmap/moving-shapes-colors unchanged
       Service     health-check  random-shapes-svc     Synced  Healthy        service/random-shapes-svc unchanged
apps   Deployment  health-check  random-shapes         Synced  Healthy        deployment.apps/random-shapes unchanged

controlplane ~ ➜  
```

The sync policy of health-check-app is none.



### Enable the automatic SYNC for the health-check-app application.

Run the below command to enable automatic SYNC for the health-check-app application.


```argocd app set --sync-policy=auto health-check-app```


### In gitops-argocd repository update the replicas to 2 in the gitops-argocd/health-check/deployment.yml file.


You can either make changes directly from Gitea or clone the repository and add/push your changes


The health-check-app application should automatically sync and the deployment should be upgraded to 2 replicas.


Note: You will need to wait a few minutes after making the changes so that ArgoCD can poll the changes from Gitea.

![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/AgroCD/assets/105126131/26342790-a40b-43ba-add5-0d8e7ba7813b)
![image](https://github.com/Althaf-official/AgroCD/assets/105126131/db44380f-fafc-4fef-b59e-bd243e4d148c)

Login to the Gitea server and edit gitops-argocd/health-check/deployment.yml file, change value for replicas from 1 to 2. Finally commit the changes.


Wait for few minutes and check the replicas now using below command:

kubectl get pod -n health-check

You should see 2 pods now.

```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get pod -n health-check
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
random-shapes-5df44bc9b-sx2j2   1/1     Running   0          29m
random-shapes-5df44bc9b-vxmp4   1/1     Running   0          39s
```

### Next, enable self-heal for the health-check-app application

Run below command:


```argocd app set health-check-app --sync-policy=auto --self-heal```

### Delete all services in the health-check namespace using kubectl -n health-check delete svc --all command.

but it will self heal . cant delete
```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl -n health-check delete svc --all
service "random-shapes-svc" deleted

controlplane ~ ➜  
```

### Now, let's enable auto-prune for the health-check-app application and then delete the gitops-argocd/health-check/service.yaml file from the gitops-argocd git repository.


Notice how Argocd will automatically remove service(s) from live state (cluster) as well.
